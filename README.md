## Overview
DefTrack is a powerful web-based tool designed to help users monitor and track deforestation activities through satellite imagery. This application utilizes a sophisticated semantic segmentation model to analyze satellite images and identify deforested areas with high precision. This repository contains the frontend code that interacts with our backend services to provide data visualization and user interaction capabilities.

## Features
- **Deforestation detection:** Utilize the semantic segmentation model to detect deforested areas.
- **Interactive map:** Mark and track areas of interest directly on the map interface.
